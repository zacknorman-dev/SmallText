SmolTxt Backlog
===============

## UI/UX Issues

- Update screen shows "Please wait" twice during firmware download - should only show once
- Remove battery indicator from splash screen
- Remove "Enter: Continue/Update | Back to Cancel" text from bottom of Check for Update screen
- No network warning in other places (not just napping screen)

## WiFi Issues

- WiFi menu title shows connected network name (e.g. "WiFi - Fomalhaut2.4G") instead of just "WiFi"
- Clicking on already-connected network in scan list should go to Network Details page
- Menu Overflow Boundary Bug still present - screen turns white when tapping down past last network

## Power Management

- Define the state of the app while it's charging (should it stay awake? show charging screen? what interactions are available?)
